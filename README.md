# inetkill
Internet Kill Switch
This is a simple tool that can be used with most VPN(like purevpn)

It even comes with a batch file that can be used to detect bittorrent
clients and to enable/disable Internet Kill Switch when needed.

But before you open the batch file YOU MUST REGISTER YOUR NETWORK
GATEWAY.

You can do that by typing:

rundll32 inetkill.dll,registerGateway your_router_ip

For help type

rundll32 inetkill.dll,help
